I am a PhD candidate at the Geneva Observatory, where I work with [David Ehrenreich](https://obswww.unige.ch/~ehrenrei/homepage/Welcome.html) and many other scientists. I am also a member of the [NCCR PlanetS](http://nccr-planets.ch) collaboration.

My main research topic is the detection and characterization of extra-solar planets, more specifically their upper atmospheres. I am also interested in solving problems related to the observation and description of stellar atmospheres and developing scientific software for the astronomical community. The main instruments I use in my research are high-resolution and/or space-based spectrographs.

Occasionally I [write software](https://github.com/ladsantos) in Python and random scripts for astronomical research. Here are some that I think could be useful for other people:

* [`radial`](https://github.com/ladsantos/radial): Pure Python code for working with radial velocities of stars with a companion (checkout the tutorial notebooks [here](https://github.com/ladsantos/RV_PS2017)).

* [`sunburn`](https://github.com/ladsantos/sunburn): Data analysis package of HST far-UV spectra.

* [`onza`](https://github.com/ladsantos/onza): Exospheres in transmission spectroscopy.

* [ESO unpack](https://github.com/ladsantos/ESO_unpack): Did you just download dozens of GBs of data from ESO's archive? This script can help you unpack the data.

I wrote summaries of interesting astronomical articles for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) between 2015 and 2017. Here are some of my favorite posts:

* [Adventures in watchmaking for cool stars](https://astrobites.org/2017/07/03/adventures-in-watchmaking-for-cool-stars/)

* [A neutron star in the Eye of Sauron?](https://astrobites.org/2017/03/24/a-neutron-star-in-the-eye-of-sauron/)

* [Strength in numbers: a smarter way to find habitable worlds](https://astrobites.org/2017/05/23/strength-in-numbers-a-smarter-way-to-find-habitable-worlds/) (also featured on [AAS NOVA](http://aasnova.org/2017/07/18/strength-in-numbers-a-smarter-way-to-find-habitable-worlds/))

* [The impact of the Physics GRE in astronomy graduate school admissions](https://astrobites.org/2016/09/09/the-impact-of-the-physics-gre-in-astronomy-graduate-admissions/)
