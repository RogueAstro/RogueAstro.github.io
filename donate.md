You can [chip in any amount through Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ladsantos/donate) to fund ladsantos.org.

Maintaining this website and blog currently has a cost of $20 per year for the custom domain. In the future, I want to implement an ad-free experience for the blog's comments section, which would be an addition of $108 per year. A custom email domain would increase the yearly costs by approximately $72 per year. Any amount you chip in will go to fund this initiative. 

Donations can also be used to fund my research (travels, equipment, software) and professional development (mainly through paid courses). Donating also signals that you are interested in the content I produce here.
