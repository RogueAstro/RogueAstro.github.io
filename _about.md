Here you will find some answers to frequent questions I get asked about myself.

My identity
-----------

I am Brazilian, latino, bisexual, and a person of color. My pronouns are he/him/his. [This is how to pronounce my name](https://forvo.com/word/leonardo/#pt). I do not know my family tree beyond a couple of generations because of the erasure of identities of people of color in Brazil, but I do know that I descend from a mix of Black, Indigenous, and European people. Despite being of color, I do not claim to be Black or have experienced being Black in my life. I have also never been in a favela.

Brief bio
---------

I grew up in a small town in the mountains of South-eastern Brazil with two brothers and my amazing parents (a salesman and a seamstress, at the time of my childhood). I studied in public schools for most of my life, and had the greatest opportunity of pursuing an academic career in my early 20s. I participated in an exchange program in Netherlands for one year in 2013-2014, and in an academic internship in the United States for six months. Currently, I am a PhD candidate of astronomy and astrophysics in Switzerland.

Interests
---------

Brazilian culture, music, non-fiction (books, screenplays, and writing), videogames, physical fitness, food tourism, coffee, biology, East-Asian culture, minimalism.
